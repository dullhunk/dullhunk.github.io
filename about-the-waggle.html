<h1>Wednesday What?</h1>


<p>There are some great opportunities for Computer Scientists both before and after graduation that we think you should know about. Rather than bombard your already overloaded inboxes with even more annoying direct messages, we'll batch them up (like the <a href="http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/mondaymail/">Monday Mail</a>) into a weekly digest which is known as the Wednesday Waggle.</p>

<p>If you know what waggle is you can ignore this bit. Otherwise, you need to know that bees have long been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_of_Manchester">Manchester icon</a>, representing both industry and community. A colony of bees lives (and dies) on its ability to pass on information to the rest of the hive about where the food is and how to get to it. To do this, bees perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance">waggle dance</a> to tell the rest of the colony where to find essential resources. They also use it to indicate where water sources and new nest-site locations are.</p>

<p>We think job opportunities, talks and application deadlines are like nectar and pollen to our busy colony of bees (that's you and over <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about/history-and-heritage/">10,000 Computer Scientists</a>) in the Kilburn building and beyond. If we can successfully disseminate this information in a timely manner, our whole community will benefit. Opportunities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spring insights and summer internships</li>
<li>Talks, workshops, networking events</li>
<li>Competitions and hackathons etc</li>
<li>Year long placements</li>
<li>Graduate positions</li>
<li>PhD studentships</li>
<li>Voluntary work</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you've anything you'd like to waggle about, tell us via <a href="https://newsagent.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tellus/5">newsagent.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tellus</a> and we'll buzz everybody about it in next Wednesdays Waggle. For more general undergraduate news, please refer as usual to the Monday Mail. Sweet!</p>

<p>Please note, we do everything we reasonably can to filter out <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jobspam">jobspam</a> and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40715655">increasing number of job scams</a>. Don't get stung!</p>

<p>The Wednesday Waggle available at <a href="https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/</a> and delivered by email to your inbox every week. You can filter these messages, by setting a mail filter for the word “Waggle” and/or the string [csjobs] which appear in the subject line.)
