		<h1>Guest Lectures in the Department of Computer Science</h1>

	<p>The school welcomes external speakers and hosts a number of guest lectures from a wide range of collaborators in industry and academia. There are several ways to arrange a guest lecture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scheduled lectures for <a href="https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus/">COMP101</a>, a first year course with 200+ enrolled students. During the academic year 2019/20, these talks take place from midday to 11.50am in Lecture Theatre 1.1 in the Kilburn building</li>
<li>School research seminars arranged by Antonio Pop, see <a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/seminars/?seminarid=past">examples of past seminars</a></li>
<li>Technical talks arranged as part of a scheduled course, <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about/people/">speak to the course leader for the relevant course</a>. These tend to be more advanced courses aimed at students later in their degrees or as part of postgraduate study.</li>
<li>One-off talks arranged <em>ad hoc</em> that are not part of scheduled series of lectures, for example Life at Google, engineering at twitter and Digital Media the BBC</li>
<li>Seminars and talks arranged by students, not academic staff, for example <a href="http://unicsmcr.com">unicsmcr.com</a>.&nbsp;You should contact the relevant society concerned, via <a href="http://manchesterstudentsunion.com/groups/">manchesterstudentsunion.com/groups</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Interested in speaking?</h2>
<p>For COMP101, we are always looking for good speakers who can engage large groups of students on interesting topics that they care about and relate to Computer Science. For COMP101, there are a limited number of guest lecture slots (around 20) which run through <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/">term-time</a> on Thursdays at 11am starting in November and finishing in early June. Its important that speakers</p>
<ol>
<li>Give <strong>much more than a sales pitch</strong> for an organisation, by providing insight into a technical subject</li>
<li>Talk about content that relates to the <a href="https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus/">(very broad) syllabus of COMP101</a></li>
<li>Engage, interact, educate and entertain. Students vote with their feet (by not turning up) if they think a lecture won't be interesting</li>
</ol>
