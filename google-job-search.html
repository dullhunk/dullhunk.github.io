  <p>Google have recently added <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/work-from-home-jobs-google-search/">more new features</a> to their job search engine. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven&#8217;t used it already try the following searches for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>software intern manchester <a href="https://g.co/kgs/87VaBe">g.co/kgs/87VaBe</a></li>
<li>business analyst intern <a href="https://g.co/kgs/7TXcBT">g.co/kgs/7TXcBT</a></li>
<li>graduate hardware engineer <a href="https://g.co/kgs/PdZm7K">g.co/kgs/PdZm7K</a></li>
<li>graduate software engineer <a href="https://g.co/kgs/xfNvVd">g.co/kgs/xfNvVd</a></li>
<li>data scientist placement <a href="https://g.co/kgs/gLpF18">g.co/kgs/gLpF18</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Google is clearly a very useful product for job hunting, but not the <em>only</em> place you can use to find jobs see <a href="https://duncan.hull.name/where">where can I look for jobs?</a></p>
<p>(Technical note, Google job search is powered by embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">microdata</a> structured using <a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting">schema.org/JobPosting</a>, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/job-posting">developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/job-posting</a>. Hopefully Google job search won&#8217;t end up in the infamous “Google Graveyard” where over 150 products ended up since 2006! The average lifespan of a discontinued Google product is just 4 years and 1 month according to <a href="https://gcemetery.co/">gcemetery.co</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for a job AT google, they have moved from <a href="http://jobs.google.com/">jobs.google.com</a> to <a href="http://careers.google.com/">careers.google.com</a>.
